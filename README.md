# Bird-Species-Identification-with-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to identify bird species based on their calls, using data sourced from Xeno-Canto, a crowd-sourced bird sounds archive. The primary goal is to develop a neural network model capable of accurately classifying bird species from audio data.
